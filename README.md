# Pixarch
![](Pixarch/IMG_7708.png)
Pixarch is a pixel-themed minimalistic Arch Linux rice. It has its own extremely minimalistic browser named Browsel, and has custom configurations for Rofi, Alacritty, i3 and Polybar.
Pixarch uses the wonderful [Monocraft](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft) font made by Idrees Hassan.

## Installation
Install scripts for various linux distributions are placed in the `installationscripts` folder. Although Pixarch is ideally meant to run for Arch Linux only, ports for Debian, Fedora, and other distributions is a work in progress.
